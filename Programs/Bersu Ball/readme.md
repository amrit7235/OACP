# Approach
The approach is based on dynamic programming. It initializes a 2D vector dp to store the lengths of the longest subarrays for various combinations of elements from arrays a and b. The algorithm iterates through both arrays and updates dp[i][j] based on four conditions:

If both a[i] and b[j] are within one unit of each other, increment the length of the current subarray.
If there are previous elements from both arrays (i - 1 and j - 1), update the length based on the previous lengths.
If there's a previous element from array a (i - 1), update the length based on the previous length.
If there's a previous element from array b (j - 1), update the length based on the previous length.
The length of the longest subarray is then obtained from dp[n - 1][m - 1], where n and m are the sizes of arrays a and b respectively.

# Complexity Analysis
Time Complexity: O(n*m), where n is the size of array a and m is the size of array b.
Space Complexity: O(n*m), as the algorithm uses a 2D vector dp of size n*m to store the lengths of the longest subarrays.
