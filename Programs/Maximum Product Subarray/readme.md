# Maximum Product of Subarray
This C++ code calculates the maximum product of a subarray from a given array of integers.

## Overview
The program defines a function maxProduct that takes a vector of integers nums as input and returns the maximum product of any contiguous subarray within the given array.

## Approach
The approach used here is to iterate through the array while keeping track of the product of elements encountered so far from both the beginning (pre) and the end (suf). This is done to handle cases where negative numbers might flip the product to be maximum.

Initialize pre and suf to 1, and ans (answer) to the minimum integer value.
Iterate through the array.
Update pre and suf by multiplying them with the current element from the beginning and end of the array respectively.
Update ans with the maximum of itself, pre, and suf.
Return ans as the maximum product of a subarray.

## Complexity Analysis
Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the size of the input array.
Space Complexity: O(1), as the algorithm uses only a constant amount of extra space.
